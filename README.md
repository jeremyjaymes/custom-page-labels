## Description

Sometimes your page titles are not quite as simple as "About Us". This can make it dificult for site administrators and developers to identify pages on the All Pages Screen, especially when you have 20+ pages in your site. This simple plugin allows you to add a more descriptive label, displayed in an admin column on the pages screen so that pages can be easily identified.
