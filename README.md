# Custom Page Labels

Custom Page Labels is a no frills WordPress plugin that allows you to add a custom label (identifier) to a page making it is easier to quickly identify a page on the all pages screen.

## Description

Not all page titles are as simple or as identifiable as "About Us" or "Home Page". More often theyâ€™re carefully crafted and even a bit lengthy. For example, about us becomes "Our Amazing Widget Company Employs Only the Best and the Brightest."

Custom Page Labels allows you to add a more descriptive label, displayed in an admin column on the pages screen so that pages can be easily identified.
