Add custom page labels to your pages so that they can be easily identified.

== Description ==
Not all page titles are as simple or as identifiable as "About Us" or "Home Page". More often theyâ€™re carefully crafted and even a bit lengthy. For example, about us becomes "Our Amazing Widget Company Employs Only the Best and the Brightest."

Identifying those pages on the All Pages Screen can be a challenge for a busy site admin looking to make quick edits.

Custom Page Labels allows you to add a more descriptive label, displayed in an admin column on the pages screen so that pages can be easily identified.
